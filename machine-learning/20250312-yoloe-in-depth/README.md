## Introduction

In recent years, the field of computer vision has witnessed groundbreaking advancements in object detection technology, particularly a gradual shift from traditional closed-set category recognition towards "open-world" object detection and segmentation capable of adapting to diverse and complex scenarios. Unlike classic YOLO models, which can only recognize predefined categories, extending YOLO, known for its real-time and efficient performance, to the open domain capable of recognizing arbitrary objects has become one of the core challenges in current research.

Against this technological backdrop, YOLOE ("YOLOE: Real-Time Seeing Anything"), officially released in March 2025, introduces an innovative unified framework. It not only supports both object detection and instance segmentation but, more importantly, achieves text-prompted, visual-prompted, and prompt-free modes, truly realizing "real-time seeing anything." For example, if you say to it, "find the coffee cup on the table," YOLOE can immediately locate and box the target. It can even easily find similar items in new scenes simply by providing an example image. Moreover, even if you don't tell it what to look for, it can independently discover and categorize arbitrary objects in an image. This capability, previously often seen only in large and complex models, has now been successfully implemented in the lightweight and fast YOLO family of models.

This article will delve into the core innovations, technical approaches, and underlying ideas of YOLOE. It will also review the evolution of the YOLO series (such as YOLO-World, YOLOv8, and YOLOv11) and Transformer architectures (such as DINO-X, Grounding DINO) and related models, exploring how they collectively contributed to the birth of YOLOE. Furthermore, we will look ahead to the development direction of object detection in the next 3-5 years, analyzing the competition between Transformer detectors (such as the RT-DETR series and the upcoming YOLOv12) and YOLOE, as well as the potential technological innovations brought by generative multimodal large models represented by Qwen2.5-VL and Moondream.

## Innovative Framework

The most striking innovation of YOLOE lies in its proposal of an efficient and unified framework that can achieve open-world object detection and instance segmentation within a single model. Traditional detection models are often only targeted at closed-set categories. Although some models can recognize arbitrary objects, this usually comes at the cost of significantly reduced efficiency or the need to introduce large language models. YOLOE ingeniously unifies text-prompted, image-prompted, and prompt-free detection, truly achieving "one model, three uses" while maintaining the hallmark efficiency of the YOLO series.

Firstly, in "text-prompted detection," YOLOE proposes a highly creative techniqueâ€”the "Reparameterizable Region-Text Alignment Strategy" (RepRTA). Simply put, it finely tunes the text embeddings of large models through an auxiliary small network, allowing visual features to seamlessly align with text descriptions. More ingeniously, this auxiliary network's parameters are cleverly "integrated" into the main model during the inference phase, achieving almost zero additional inference overhead. YOLOE cleverly "freeloads" on the semantic knowledge of large language models while avoiding the heavy computation of large models. For example, when you tell YOLOE, "find the kitten on the sofa," it does not need additional large model assistance; instead, it directly completes the task quickly using its built-in semantic alignment capability.

In "visual-prompted detection" mode, YOLOE designs a clever "Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder" (SAVPE). This module decomposes the information in an example image into two branches: high-level semantics (e.g., item category) and low-level visual activations (e.g., specific contours or texture features). Then, it effectively fuses these two types of information into the backbone features. This decoupled design allows YOLOE to achieve precise target localization with extremely low overhead. Imagine you want to find a rare antique collectible. Just take a picture of a similar item and show it to YOLOE, and it can immediately and accurately locate the position and contour of similar objects in the image in front of you, without retraining or massive data support.

Even more commendable is that YOLOE can still perform "prompt-free open detection" autonomously without any prompts. The authors ingeniously proposed the "Lazy Region-Prompt Contrastive Strategy" (LRPC), which incorporates a vast vocabulary of categories and corresponding embedding vectors. Through contrastive learning, it enables the model to "remember" a rich object concept space, allowing the model to autonomously match arbitrary object regions with corresponding category embedding features. In other words, even if you don't tell it anything, it can quickly identify and locate various items in any scene like a "familiar old friend," without relying on additional language models to generate descriptions, thus ensuring real-time performance and low computational cost.

In summary, YOLOE truly achieves the ability to meet the needs of both closed-set and open-set, multiple prompting methods and prompt-free scenarios with just one model through the above three complementary modules, striking an elegant balance between speed and accuracy. This design undoubtedly provides an excellent reference case for industry and academia, and it fills us with anticipation for the next step in the development of object detection technology.

For a detailed exploration of the methods, please refer to the previous article [YOLOE Paper Reading](../20250311-yoloe-paper-reading/README.md), which will not be repeated here.

## Performance Evaluation

Thanks to the three meticulously designed modules mentioned above, YOLOE achieves impressive "one-model-multiple-capabilities": a single model can simultaneously handle closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection and instance segmentation, and can flexibly adapt to text, image prompts, and completely prompt-free application scenarios, while maintaining the real-time performance that the YOLO series is proud of.

In specific experiments, the authors conducted detailed tests on the zero-shot detection and instance segmentation capabilities of YOLOE on the LVIS dataset. For example, the YOLOE-v8-L model, based on the YOLOv8 large backbone, achieved a detection accuracy of 35.9 AP in zero-shot conditions (i.e., without ever seeing relevant category data) with only text prompts, and 34.2 AP using image prompts. This means that YOLOE can well recognize new categories of objects it has never learned, relying only on simple descriptions in natural language. If you give YOLOE a reference image, it can also quickly "learn and apply" to accurately locate targets in new images.

To better illustrate the progress of YOLOE, we can compare it with the previously widely noted YOLO-World. The YOLO-Worldv2-L model achieved a maximum score of approximately 35.5 AP and achieved real-time performance of 80.0 FPS on a T4 GPU, which is already very outstanding. However, YOLOE-v8-S/M/L models achieved zero-shot detection performance exceeding the latter by 3.5/0.2/0.4 AP with only about one-third of the training time of YOLO-World-v2-S/M/L. Furthermore, their inference speeds on the T4 GPU are 1.4/1.3/1.3 times faster, respectively, truly "surpassing the predecessor."

For example, the training time for YOLOE-v8-S is 12.0 hours, while YOLO-Worldv2-S is 41.7 hours, reducing training costs by approximately 3 times. The FPS of YOLOE-v8-S on T4 GPU is 305.8, and on iPhone 12 is 64.3, which are 1.4 times and 1.3 times of YOLO-Worldv2-S, respectively.

Furthermore, in zero-shot instance segmentation, the YOLOE-v8-L model also performs outstandingly, achieving a mask AP of 23.5 on the LVIS dataset, reaching a very competitive level. When the authors migrated YOLOE to traditional object detection tasks (such as the COCO dataset) for full-data fine-tuning, its performance advantages became even more apparent: the YOLOE-v8-L model obtained a detection mAP of 53.0% and an instance segmentation mAP of 42.7%, which are 0.6 and 0.4 percentage points higher than the closed-set model YOLOv8-L using the same backbone, respectively.

More noteworthy is that because YOLOE has fully "seen" a rich open-world vocabulary during the pre-training phase, it only requires about a quarter of the training time of traditional YOLO models to reach a higher level of accuracy when fine-tuning on the COCO dataset. This feature is a model of "time-saving and effort-saving," which is very suitable for the industry's need to quickly implement new applications.

The above experimental results clearly illustrate the excellent performance of YOLOE in terms of zero-shot generalization ability, cross-dataset migration performance, and inference speed and training efficiency. It can be said that it inherits the real-time and efficient tradition of the YOLO series and draws on the generalization advantages of visual-language models in recent years, perfectly integrating real-time, efficiency, and open vocabulary, laying a solid foundation for more diverse visual applications in the future.

## Technological Evolution

### Technical Background

The emergence of YOLOE is not accidental, nor is it a creation out of thin air, but rather it stands on the foundation of technological innovations in the field of object detection over the past few years. From the classic YOLO series models to the recently popular multimodal open-vocabulary detection technologies, all have provided valuable nourishment for YOLOE. Next, we will chronologically sort out the YOLO-World series, the YOLO family (YOLOv8 to YOLOv11), and Transformer-based detection models (such as the DINO series and Grounding DINO) to see how they paved the way for the birth of YOLOE step by step.

#### YOLO-World: Opening the Door to the Open World for YOLO

YOLO-World, proposed by Tencent AI Lab in 2024, is a real-time open-vocabulary detection model that can be seen as the most direct technical "predecessor" of YOLOE. Traditional YOLO models excel in efficiency, but their categories are always limited by the training set. To enable the YOLO series to also recognize new categories, YOLO-World first introduced the pre-training ideas of visual-language models (such as CLIP) into the YOLO architecture. Specifically, they creatively proposed the "Reparameterizable Vision-Language Path Fusion Network" (RepVL-PAN), cleverly fusing text features into YOLO's feature pyramid, and then aligning vision and language in a common space through region-text contrastive loss. In this way, YOLO-World can not only detect categories already in the training set but also "learn without a teacher" to recognize new concepts. To use a vivid analogy, it's like giving YOLO, which originally only understood image language, the "hearing" of language, enabling it to understand object concepts described by users in natural language and then detect the corresponding targets in the image.

YOLO-World not only first realized this concept but also achieved excellent results of 35.4 AP in the LVIS dataset with a real-time performance of up to 52 FPS (V100 GPU). This provided a realistic reference for YOLOE: how to effectively utilize language information without sacrificing inference speed. It is worth mentioning that YOLO-World's subsequent improved version, YOLO-World-v2, further optimized the training strategy and added an image prompt mode, which provided further practical experience for YOLOE. In fact, YOLOE is based on absorbing the successful experiences of YOLO-World and proposes a more efficient "trinity" architecture, surpassing the former with lower training costs and better performance.

In the exploration of the YOLO-World series, we also clearly see how to expand the semantic scope of YOLO while maintaining real-time performance. This greatly inspired YOLOE's idea of designing the RepRTA module, that is, using reparameterization to achieve zero-overhead fusion of language information, which can be said to inherit the core innovation idea of YOLO-World. At the same time, YOLOE also took the opportunity to surpass it: achieving higher zero-shot accuracy with only one-third of the training time of YOLO-World.

#### YOLOv8 and YOLOv11: Continuous Evolution of the YOLO Family

The reason why YOLOE can quickly adapt to open-world detection tasks is that the underlying technical support is inseparable from the excellent foundation accumulated by the YOLO series models over many years. YOLOE is essentially developed based on YOLOv8 and YOLOv11, so it is necessary for us to briefly review the changes and contributions of the latest generations of YOLO models.

YOLOv8, released by the Ultralytics team in early 2023, brought several structural improvements such as anchor-free design, C2f backbone network, and decoupled head (separate classification and regression branches), which improved the real-time detection accuracy of the YOLO family. By 2024, Ultralytics further launched YOLOv11, which, while maintaining detection accuracy, significantly reduced the model parameters by optimizing the network backbone and neck structure, further improving the model's deployment capability on edge devices. For example, YOLOv11-M has about 22% fewer parameters than YOLOv8-M, but its detection performance is even better. These continuous architectural optimizations provided a solid foundation of detection capabilities for YOLOE.

YOLOE cleverly borrowed these efficient basic architectures of YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 and inserted its own unique open-vocabulary modules on this basis. Because of this, YOLOE can perform almost as well as dedicated closed-set models when migrated to traditional detection datasets, which can be called "innovation standing on the shoulders of giants."

In addition, the recent YOLOv12 goes a step further, introducing the Region Attention Module (AÂ²) and efficient attention mechanism (FlashAttention), significantly improving the model's global perception ability and efficiency. This change also foreshadows the trend of future fusion of the YOLO series and Transformer architecture, which exactly matches YOLOE's design concept: unifying efficiency and richer functions. If this trend becomes a reality, then the boundary between the YOLO family and the Transformer architecture will gradually blur, and the next generation version of YOLOE may also incorporate more advantages of Transformer to achieve a higher level of general detection capability.

#### DINO Series and Grounding DINO: Open-Vocabulary Detection Benchmarks for Transformer Architectures

Outside of CNN architectures, detectors based on Transformer are also booming. Since 2023, the DINO and Grounding DINO series models developed by the IDEA team have applied Transformer to the field of open-vocabulary detection and have achieved remarkable results. These methods mainly achieve the fusion of images and text through the attention mechanism of Transformer and cross-modal alignment, and have achieved extremely high zero-shot detection accuracy. For example, Grounding DINO achieved an unprecedented 52.5 AP on the COCO zero-shot detection task. This breakthrough in performance clearly demonstrates the huge advantages of the Transformer architecture in multimodal fusion.

Especially the recently launched DINO-X model, it not only supports text prompts but can also handle image prompts and even prompt-free situations, almost realizing true "universal recognition." DINO-X utilizes large-scale training of over one hundred million image-text pairs and performs excellently in recognizing rare long-tailed objects, significantly leading previous open detectors. This idea inspired the LRPC (Lazy Region-Prompt Contrastive Strategy) proposed by YOLOE: that is, to build a rich category dictionary and embedding vectors into the model during the training phase, allowing the model to learn a universal visual concept space, so that the model can automatically classify all objects without any additional prompts.

Although DINO-X achieves higher accuracy through a large amount of data and Transformer architecture, its model is large and computationally intensive, which is very different from YOLOE's emphasis on efficient real-time performance. After drawing inspiration from the DINO series, YOLOE made its own innovative choice, achieving efficient open-vocabulary capabilities in a more lightweight way that does not rely on large models, thus being more advantageous in practical deployment scenarios.

In summary, we can clearly see that YOLOE's innovation comes from the fusion of two technical veins: on the one hand, it draws on the efficient and stable network design accumulated by the YOLO series over a long period; on the other hand, it also draws on advanced open-vocabulary and cross-modal alignment technologies such as YOLO-World and Grounding DINO. YOLOE successfully found a just-right balance between these two and also pointed out a development path that is both efficient and open for the future of object detection.

### Development History of the Field

Reviewing the development history of object detection helps us better understand what the emergence of YOLOE and similar works really means. Computer vision object detection technology has experienced a leapfrog progress from the traditional era of manual features to the deep learning era, and now to the open-vocabulary era. At the same time, "open-vocabulary object detection and segmentation," as an emerging direction, has also rapidly risen in recent years and become a research hotspot. These two technical paths ultimately converged ingeniously in models like YOLOE.

#### Development of Traditional Object Detection: From R-CNN to the Evolution History of YOLO

Object detection, as a classic task in computer vision, has undergone tremendous changes in the past ten years. Early methods relied on manually designed features and sliding window search, which were inefficient and lacked generalization. Until 2012, with the rise of deep learning, two-stage detectors represented by R-CNN (candidate box extraction first and then classification) began to emerge, and accuracy rapidly improved. Subsequently, the emergence of the YOLO series of single-stage detectors completely changed the ecology of this field. YOLOv1 proposed the idea of "one-step" single regression, which immediately increased the speed of detection to near real-time levels. This strategy of "looking at the entire image at once and immediately outputting the positions of all objects" made object detection closer to real-world application needs, and also made the YOLO series quickly become a favorite in industry and academia.

Although initially slightly inferior to two-stage methods in terms of accuracy, subsequent YOLOv2, YOLOv3, and YOLOv4 and other continuously improved model structures and training strategies, the accuracy of the YOLO series gradually approached and even surpassed traditional two-stage methods. By 2020, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7 and other models went a step further, proposing richer optimization strategies. For example, YOLOv7 achieved a COCO mAP of 56.8% after introducing the extended ELAN structure, reaching a surprising balance between efficiency and accuracy. YOLOv8 and the latest YOLOv11 further built on this idea, further improved the anchor box design and optimized the decoupled head structure, pushing the YOLO series to a new height, providing an ideal starting point for subsequent innovations of YOLOE. This series of developments provided a solid starting point for later new-generation models such as YOLOE, making it possible to further expand to the open world.

#### The Rise of Open-Vocabulary Object Detection

Although traditional detection methods have achieved great success in terms of efficiency and accuracy, there is always a fundamental problem, that is, they can only recognize object categories that have appeared in training. However, actual scenarios are ever-changing, and it is impossible to pre-define all possible categories. This has spawned a new research direction of "Open-Vocabulary Detection" (OVD).

This field truly ushered in a major turning point after the emergence of visual-language pre-training models such as CLIP. Represented by ViLD proposed by Google, by fusing the knowledge of image detection models and large-scale image-text pre-training models, models can detect object categories not seen in the training set without direct annotation. Methods such as ViLD and GLIP significantly improved the detection performance of unseen categories, even approaching the level of supervised models, through the pre-training paradigm of image-text feature alignment. For example, GLIP achieved a zero-shot score of nearly 50 AP on COCO, completely subverting people's understanding of traditional detection models. This paradigm was later borrowed and optimized by real-time detectors such as YOLO-World and YOLOE, so that open-vocabulary capabilities are no longer the patent of large Transformer models but can be deployed in efficient real-time detectors.

YOLOE benefits from the promotion of this technological trend, achieving cross-modal alignment with extremely low additional computational overhead, so that the generalization ability of real-time detectors in the face of unknown categories has been greatly improved. This reflects that moving from fixed categories to the open world is not only a technological breakthrough but also an inevitable trend in the development of visual models.

#### Development of Open-Vocabulary Segmentation

In addition to object detection, open-vocabulary segmentation tasks have also rapidly emerged in recent years, especially in the fields of image semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. For example, Google's OpenSeg model adopted an innovative method of using image caption information to learn segmentation masks, and for the first time realized directly generating corresponding segmentation regions with arbitrary text descriptions as input. The emergence of OpenSeeD and SAM (Segment Anything Model) further promoted this trend, enabling models not only to freely segment arbitrary objects but also to achieve interactive segmentation by combining user input.

Taking OpenSeeD as an example, it first proposed a unified training framework for detection and segmentation tasks, which inspired the fusion design of YOLOE to simultaneously achieve detection and instance segmentation. SAM (Segment Anything Model) realized true "segmentation by pointing," although SAM itself does not have category recognition capabilities, but when combined with open-vocabulary detection models (such as Grounding DINO), it can achieve a complete detection-to-segmentation integrated process. This trend of technology fusion is also fully reflected in YOLOE: YOLOE can complete detection and segmentation tasks at once, providing more refined target localization capabilities in the open world.

The future development trend of open-vocabulary segmentation technology may be more closely integrated with real-time detection models like YOLOE that have multiple modal prompts, making image understanding models not only able to quickly detect objects but also accurately segment and label the contours of these objects. This unified trend provides an efficient and general visual understanding front-end for subsequent autonomous driving, robot vision perception, and AR/VR scene understanding.

In summary, YOLOE was born at such a crossroads and is a representative work of the current trend of fusion of detection and segmentation technologies: it not only inherits the essence of the YOLO series for more than ten years, continuing the efficient architecture; but also absorbs the latest cross-modal fusion ideas in the field of open-vocabulary detection and segmentation, and obtains the generalization ability of open recognition from visual-language models. We are in an era where object detection is transforming from pure technology competition to multimodal fusion, real-time efficiency, and open capabilities, and YOLOE is providing an ideal paradigm at this critical node.

## Application Fields

The technological breakthrough of YOLOE not only brightens the eyes of researchers but also makes the prospects for application in various fields particularly broad. From multiple object tracking (MOT) to robot perception, and then to autonomous driving and 3D vision tasks, YOLOE provides an efficient and flexible visual solution, greatly promoting the entry of computer vision technology into the real world.

### Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Object Re-identification (ReID)

In practical application scenarios, object detection models not only undertake recognition tasks but are usually combined with other tasks, such as multiple object tracking (MOT) and object re-identification (ReID). The current mainstream tracking methods mostly adopt the "tracking-by-detection" strategy, that is, first obtain the target position through a detection model, and then use a tracking algorithm to associate the motion trajectories of the same target in consecutive frames. In this regard, the YOLO series has been widely used for its speed and high accuracy. For example, the famous ByteTrack algorithm uses YOLOX for front-end object detection and is combined with simple and efficient association algorithms (such as BYTE or IOU matching), which can achieve industry-leading real-time tracking performance on benchmarks such as MOT17.

YOLOE demonstrates greater potential on this basis. Due to its open-vocabulary capability, the tracking system will no longer be limited to traditional preset categories but can easily cope with any newly emerging targets, thereby greatly expanding the practical scope of the tracking system. For example, suppose a drone needs to track rare objects in a field search and rescue scene, such as specific rescue signs or wild animals. Traditional models may not be able to recognize them, let alone track them; however, using YOLOE, only a reference image or a simple text description is needed to immediately achieve detection and tracking of the unknown target without retraining the model for the new target.

In the future, YOLOE's visual semantic embedding vectors can be directly used as input to tracking algorithms for matching targets in different frames. For example, efficient multiple object tracking can be directly achieved through cosine similarity, eliminating the trouble of separately training ReID models and simplifying system complexity. For example, in a monitoring system, YOLOE can simultaneously detect and output unique embedding features for each person, thereby real-time judging the identity of people in different cameras, greatly improving the tracking efficiency across cameras.

In addition, YOLOE is also very suitable for integration into the recently popular end-to-end "Joint Detection and Embedding" (JDE) framework. In the past, detection and re-identification tasks were trained separately by two models, which not only had high training costs but also low inference efficiency. The JDE model cleverly merges these two tasks into the same neural network. In addition to outputting the target position, the detector will also additionally learn the embedding features of the target appearance, so that detection and target identity feature extraction are completed simultaneously, and cross-frame target matching can be completed with one output. YOLOE itself has rich visual semantic embeddings, which can play an important role in associating the same target in different frames by directly using or slightly fine-tuning them.

To give a practical example: suppose a smart warehouse is equipped with multiple cameras for cargo transportation tracking. In the past, a detection and tracking system needed to be specially trained for each new item. With YOLOE, as long as an image prompt is provided once, new products can be immediately recognized and tracked, which greatly simplifies the difficulty of deployment. Considering that YOLOE itself also has instance segmentation function, this is especially useful for scenarios that require precise positioning and shape analysis. For example, robots can use this to determine the specific position and pose of a certain cargo to achieve precise grasping.

### 3D Vision: From Plane to Stereo World

YOLOE's capabilities are not limited to 2D images; it also has the potential to become an important component of 3D perception systems. Although YOLOE itself is a 2D detection model, it can be quickly adapted to the application scenarios of 3D detection and segmentation through simple extensions.

For example, if you want to make YOLOE a monocular 3D detector, you only need to add regression branches for 3D information such as target depth, size, and pose to the original detection output. In actual operation, YOLOE can add a lightweight depth estimation module outside the backbone network to real-time predict the scene depth map, so that the position of each detection box can have accurate 3D coordinates. This design can be quickly deployed on mobile robots, drones, and other equipment. For example, an indoor patrol robot can accurately identify the locations of furniture and obstacles through the 2D box positions provided by YOLOE and the estimated distance to achieve autonomous navigation.

Another scenario is to combine multimodal sensor information. YOLOE can be used as a visual modality to fuse with other sensors, such as cooperating with lidar or depth cameras to give objects in the environment accurate 3D coordinates and semantic labels. Or YOLOE can first perform preliminary localization and classification of targets at the visual level, and then combine lidar or depth sensors to accurately measure 3D spatial positions, forming high-precision obstacle maps, thereby building a richer and more accurate environmental perception system. This combined perception system will bring higher scene understanding capabilities to autonomous driving, service robots, drones, etc., and significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of perception tasks.

Recently, a work called Open-YOLO 3D has gone a step further and attempted to use the open-vocabulary detection results of multi-view images to automatically assign semantic labels to 3D point clouds. This technical direction is very suitable for using YOLOE as a 2D detection component. Its open recognition capability can provide accurate semantic annotation for 3D reconstruction, such as helping drones automatically label buildings, roads, and even sudden obstacles when scanning urban environments, forming real-time updated 3D semantic maps.

In addition, YOLOE can also be combined with 3D vision tasks (depth estimation, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, SLAM, etc.) to achieve scene understanding. Some recent works have attempted to train general 3D vision foundation models to unify multi-tasks. For example, the DUSt3R (Dense Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction) framework was proposed for uncalibrated dense stereo reconstruction and achieved SOTA in tasks such as monocular/multiview depth estimation and relative pose estimation. DUSt3R uses Transformer to predict dense point clouds and can recover 3D structures from image collections without camera parameters. If the object detection results of YOLOE are combined with this type of 3D reconstruction model, joint geometric and semantic perception can be achieved. Imagine such a system: DUSt3R or its improved version (such as MV-DUSt3R+) continuously updates the 3D point cloud or mesh of the scene from video frames (similar to the continuously updated Transformer 3D reconstruction model proposed by CUT3R, which can maintain the scene state updated over time), while YOLOE provides detection and classification for objects appearing in new frames. By embedding the objects recognized by YOLOE into the reconstructed 3D scene, we can obtain a dynamic scene model with semantic labels. For example, in the reconstruction of an indoor room, YOLOE recognizes "chair," "table," "cup," etc., and marks their positions in the point cloud; when these objects are moved or new objects appear, the continuous 3D perception model CUT3R will update the structure, while YOLOE will update the semantics. This collaboration enables robots to "understand" the complete scene, including both geometric and semantic aspects.

YOLOE can also play a role in stereo and multi-view matching tasks. For example, in multi-view geometry, it is usually necessary to find corresponding pixels (feature matching) in each view and then calculate camera poses and 3D points. In this regard, DUSt3R has made progress through 3D point cloud map regression and Transformer matching. YOLOE can provide additional information: it can detect key target objects (such as road signs, furniture) in the scene to act as feature anchors to help matching. In addition, for each predicted 3D point or local fragment, if semantic labels recognized by YOLOE can be assigned (for example, this is "a point of a car" or "a point of a tree"), SLAM and relocalization will be more robust because semantics can be used as constraints. Recently, there has also been a trend of introducing semantics into SLAM, and the open-set labels provided by YOLOE allow the system to recognize and utilize previously undefined new landmark objects.

### Autonomous Driving and Robot Perception

Autonomous driving is one of the most widely used scenarios for computer vision applications, and it has extremely high requirements for the real-time performance, generalization ability, and accuracy of detection algorithms. In this context, the unique open-vocabulary advantage of YOLOE can solve the problem that traditional visual models cannot recognize novel objects.

Compared with traditional detectors that can only recognize predefined obstacles, YOLOE only needs a simple text prompt, such as "obstacles on the road," to identify sudden situations on the road, such as fallen suitcases, tires, branches, or other unexpected obstacles, which is crucial for improving driving safety.

For example, suppose an animal suddenly appears in front of a car while driving and crosses the road. This sudden situation may not have relevant training data in traditional models, resulting in inaccurate recognition, but YOLOE can immediately react with the help of text prompts, effectively reducing the risk of collision. At the same time, YOLOE's built-in instance segmentation function can directly provide clear target contours for vehicles, which helps to accurately plan avoidance paths. In addition, YOLOE's real-time performance means that it can be deployed on the vehicle's on-board computing equipment to real-time detect pedestrians, vehicles, and other obstacles on the road, and quickly provide the results to the path planning system.

Furthermore, if YOLOE can combine depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction information, its detection and segmentation results can even directly provide the 3D position of the target and obtain semantic point clouds, so that cameras can also complete tasks similar to lidar in some cases, which has obvious advantages in cost-sensitive driverless scenarios.

The field of robotics also benefits from the openness and real-time performance of YOLOE. Taking industrial robotic arms as an example, traditional visual recognition models can usually only recognize fixed-category objects trained in advance, while YOLOE can achieve "recognize as you see." Just tell it what to grasp through text or example images, and it can quickly locate the target in the field of view and output accurate contour information, helping the robotic arm to quickly and accurately grasp items. This function is particularly suitable for "small-batch, multi-variety" production tasks of flexible production lines, allowing robots to efficiently handle diversified materials or parts without frequently changing models.

In addition, drone inspections and home service robots can also greatly benefit from YOLOE. For example, when drones patrol in the wild, they can real-time identify and track special targets (such as wild animals or specific landmarks); home service robots can quickly recognize various items in daily home scenes, respond to user commands at any time, accurately locate and operate household items, making robots more intelligent and closer to life.

In summary, YOLOE's open-vocabulary capability, efficient real-time performance, and ease of integration with other technologies make it have broad application potential in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics. In the next few years, with the further improvement of model performance and deployment efficiency, YOLOE is likely to become the core engine of a new generation of real-time intelligent perception systems, bringing more intelligent experiences to more fields.

## Future Trends

Looking ahead to the next three to five years, the field of object detection will usher in several significant development trends: Transformer architecture will further penetrate into the field of real-time detection, generative multimodal large models (such as Qwen2.5-VL, Moondream) will bring revolutionary paradigm shifts to object detection, and open-vocabulary detection models that integrate multi-tasks will gradually become mainstream.

### Impact of Transformer Architecture

The YOLO series is known for the efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), while Transformer detectors represented by DETR are favored for their excellent global perception ability. In the past, Transformer detectors have always been slightly inferior to YOLO in terms of real-time performance, but the recent advent of the RT-DETR series has successfully changed this situation. For example, the latest RT-DETRv3 has achieved real-time speeds close to the YOLO series, and its accuracy is even surpassed. This shows that the future field of real-time detection may gradually integrate the advantages of CNN and Transformer to form a more efficient and accurate hybrid architecture.

Specifically, in the next few years, we may see the YOLO series introduce Transformer modules into the basic architecture, such as attention mechanisms or efficient local Transformers, to further enhance generalization capabilities. Imagine this "YOLO+Transformer" hybrid model, which can run at high speed like traditional YOLO and handle complex scenes like Transformer. YOLOE may be the first step in this direction, setting an example for future real-time open detection models.

From an architectural perspective, this trend means that the boundary between CNN and Transformer will gradually blur, and the fusion and complementarity of the two may become the norm. Perhaps in a few years, the detectors we deploy on edge devices will no longer distinguish between CNN or Transformer, but rather a clever fusion of the two to achieve both efficiency and intelligence.

### Impact of Generative Multimodal AI on Object Detection

Generative multimodal large models (such as Alibaba's Qwen2.5-VL and Moondream, etc.) are also developing rapidly. With their powerful visual understanding and language generation capabilities, they are reshaping people's understanding and expectations of object detection tasks. These models can not only recognize objects but also describe and locate arbitrary objects in images in natural language, and even output bounding box and attribute information in a structured way (such as JSON). For example, when you ask Qwen2.5-VL: "Where is the red car in the picture?" it will directly return the precise coordinate position of the car without you having to train any specialized detection models in advance.

However, although current generative large models have powerful versatility and interactive capabilities, their real-time detection performance and bounding box accuracy are still inferior to dedicated YOLOE and other models. Therefore, in the short term, they will not directly replace traditional detectors. A more likely scenario is to form complementary advantages with traditional detection models. For example, the mobile terminal may first use YOLOE for fast and efficient real-time detection, while the cloud terminal will use large models for more complex semantic understanding, result verification, or scene analysis.

At the same time, these generative models can also greatly reduce annotation costs and even synthesize massive amounts of training data, thereby improving the performance of detectors on long-tailed and rare categories. For example, when there is too little data for a new category to effectively train a detector, large models can be used to automatically generate realistic images and corresponding annotations, allowing YOLOE and other detectors to easily "master" the recognition ability of long-tailed objects.

In the next three to five years, we may see such a scene: generative large models and dedicated detectors cooperate with each other. Large models are responsible for open, interactive recognition and understanding, while dedicated detectors focus on fast and accurate real-time perception, jointly building a more flexible and powerful visual cognitive system.

### Prediction of Object Detection Trends in the Next 3-5 Years

It is foreseeable that open-vocabulary detection will gradually become the standard mode in the field of object detection. YOLOE has proven that real-time detection can also embrace the open world without increasing a large amount of computational overhead. Future new models will inevitably continue to strengthen this trend. At the same time, the concept of "multi-task fusion" will also be more deeply rooted in people's hearts: detection, segmentation, tracking, and even object recognition will gradually converge into the same model framework, and output complete visual understanding results at one time.

In addition, with the rapid rise of 3D vision technology and geometric foundation models, the field of object detection may further develop towards "spatiotemporal perception." Future autonomous driving systems will no longer detect frame by frame independently but will build and continuously update 3D models of scenes through continuous video sequences. Models like YOLOE may serve as visual front-ends, real-time providing accurate target recognition and localization information, and integrate into the entire dynamic perception system, thereby forming an intelligent vision system that can understand space, semantics, and time changes.

Another noteworthy trend is the improvement of "long-term, cross-camera perception" capabilities. Imagine that smart cameras in future urban surveillance systems can not only recognize objects but also automatically track targets across cameras and perform intelligent retrieval: "Please help me find all locations of the person wearing a blue jacket and a backpack in the past 10 minutes." The realization of this vision requires close integration of detection models with spatiotemporal tracking models or long-term Transformer, and lightweight and efficient models such as YOLOE will be a crucial link in this technology chain.

Finally, although future models will become more and more powerful, computational efficiency and deployment practicality will never be ignored. No matter how technology evolves, hardware constraints and cost limitations in the real world determine that efficient and lightweight model architectures will definitely continue to maintain an important position. YOLOE was born under this trend and is bound to continue to lead the practical and open development of object detection technology.

## Conclusion

Looking at the entire design of YOLOE, it is not difficult to see that this is a model of the fusion innovation of object detection technology and multimodal visual understanding in recent years. It not only inherits the real-time and efficient characteristics of the YOLO series for a long time but also cleverly integrates open-vocabulary detection and instance segmentation functions into a unified architecture, realizing true "real-time seeing anything." Whether it is text prompts, image prompts, or completely prompt-free situations, YOLOE can provide results with satisfactory speed and accuracy. This capability, which was usually only achieved in complex large models in the past, is easily achieved by YOLOE with a lightweight design, which is a significant milestone in the visual field.

Looking at the history of technological evolution, YOLOE is not an accidental work, but a collection of the essence of two important development directions in the past few years: on the one hand, it benefits from the continuous iteration of the YOLO series in architecture and training, standing on the shoulders of excellent predecessors such as YOLOv8 and YOLOv11; on the other hand, it draws on the cutting-edge experience of open-vocabulary models such as YOLO-World and Grounding DINO in visual-language alignment and cross-modal understanding, thus bringing lightweight models into a new era of the open world. YOLOE can therefore stand out in zero-shot generalization and cross-scene migration performance, while maintaining efficient computing performance and easy deployment characteristics.

Looking to the future, the field of object detection will continue to move forward along the path of "open vocabulary, multi-task fusion." The boundary between Transformer architecture and the YOLO series will become increasingly blurred, and the advantages of the two will gradually merge with each other, forming more general and more efficient new detectors. The rise of generative multimodal large models will further promote the paradigm change of object detection, making detection tasks no longer limited to traditional box and category prediction, but developing towards richer semantic understanding and interactive perception. YOLOE and the lightweight open-vocabulary detection route it represents will become an important driving force for achieving this vision, helping us build more intelligent, flexible, and practical visual systems.

In such an era full of opportunities, I believe that the spirit of innovation embodied by YOLOE will continue to inspire the entire field to move forward. From research laboratories to practical applications, the real-time open visual perception paradigm pioneered by YOLOE will surely have a profound impact on more fields, bringing us one step closer to the future of "seeing anything."
