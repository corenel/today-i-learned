# Latent Space Revolution: A Deep Dive into VAE Architectures and Performance Comparison of Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion

by @corenel (Yusu Pan) and OpenAI Deep Research

## Introduction

In recent years, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have made significant progress in image generation and reconstruction. Among them, Stable Diffusion, as a representative LDM, achieves efficient and high-resolution text-to-image generation by performing diffusion sampling in the latent space, which is outside the image pixel space. However, the foundation of all this lies in a crucial module: the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The VAE compresses the original image into a low-dimensional latent representation, and then the decoder reconstructs the image. This process significantly reduces the computational overhead of running diffusion models, making high-resolution image generation possible. Last year (2024), the core R&D team of Stable Diffusion, after leaving, launched a new model Flux.1, dubbed the "spiritual successor" of Stable Diffusion 3. Its architecture has made several improvements based on the LDM concept. Among them, the most notable are the adjustments to the VAE module and the latent space. At the same time, academia and industry have also proposed many new autoencoder schemes, such as VQ-VAE (Vector Quantized VAE) and the latest DC-AE (Deep Compression Autoencoder), demonstrating strong performance in image/video reconstruction and compression.

This article will deeply analyze Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion, as well as related LDM architectures, with a particular focus on the VAE-related parts, and comprehensively compare them with traditional and latest autoencoder methods (such as VQ-VAE, DC-AE, classic convolutional autoencoders, etc.). Starting with the analysis of network architectures, we will detail the network composition and VAE module design differences between Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion; then compare their performance in terms of computational efficiency, reconstruction quality, compression ratio, and inference speed; sort out the development context of VAE technology and the evolution of LDM technology; and provide empirical analysis combined with literature and public experimental data to discuss the performance and cases of these methods in different application scenarios such as image and video reconstruction and compression. Finally, we will also look forward to the application prospects of these technologies in fields such as image compression coding and artistic creation. Through the analysis in this article, readers will fully understand the improvements of Flux.1 compared to Stable Diffusion, as well as the core role and evolution direction of VAE in modern generative models.

## Architecture Analysis: Comparison between Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion

### Stable Diffusion Architecture Overview

Stable Diffusion belongs to the latent diffusion model family. Its overall architecture consists of two main parts: a pre-trained VAE that maps images to and from the latent space; and a diffusion model (usually a U-Net structure) that performs progressive noise removal sampling in the latent space to generate conditional latent variables, which are finally decoded by the VAE to obtain images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion's VAE typically adopts a convolutional encoder-decoder structure with a KL regularization term to constrain the encoded distribution (hence the name Autoencoder KL). The encoder compresses the input image into a low-dimensional continuous latent variable representation (usually with a spatial size of 1/8 of the original image) and outputs the mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution. During training, a KL divergence loss is applied to the latent variables to encourage their distribution to approach a standard normal distribution. This design ensures the continuity and diversity of the latent space, which is conducive to the stable training and generalization of the diffusion model. The standard VAE of the Stable Diffusion 1 series models compresses a $512\times512$ image into a $64\times64\times4$ latent variable tensor (compression factor of 8), meaning each latent variable corresponds to an $8\times8$ pixel block in the original image. Compared to diffusing directly in the $512\times512\times3$ pixel space, this latent variable representation significantly reduces the computational load of the model by approximately $8^2=64$ times.

The diffusion model part of Stable Diffusion was initially based on a U-Net convolutional network, incorporating a cross-modal attention mechanism (Cross-Attention) to integrate text embeddings into the denoising process of image latent variables. Subsequent versions (such as Stable Diffusion 2 and SDXL) have been enhanced in terms of model parameter scale and architectural details, such as introducing larger UNets, dual text encoders, and improvements related to high resolution. However, its core still follows the paradigm of "diffusion in latent space + VAE decoding". It is worth mentioning that the official Stable Diffusion team had attempted to use VQ-VAE to replace the traditional VAE during development. According to the experiments reported in the appendix of their paper, a VQ-VAE with a codebook size of 8192 and an encoding dimension of 3 can achieve the best reconstruction metrics. VQ-VAE, or Vector Quantized VAE, was proposed by van den Oord et al. in 2017. Unlike standard VAEs, the encoder of VQ-VAE outputs discrete codewords rather than continuous distributions, using predefined codebook vectors to approximate the encoder output and forming latent variable representations through codebook indices. This avoids the blurring caused by Gaussian sampling in traditional VAEs and circumvents the situation where a powerful decoder causes the encoder to "collapse" and ignore latent variables. However, in the actual open-source models of Stable Diffusion, a continuous latent variable VAE was ultimately adopted instead of VQ-VAE. Community discussions speculate that this is because a continuous latent variable space is more convenient to connect with the diffusion process and is simpler and more robust to train—continuous VAEs provide a smooth latent space, which helps the diffusion model learn "subtle continuous changes," while discrete encoding may increase training difficulty or require complex prior models to generate codebook sequences.

### Flux.1 Architecture Improvements

Flux.1 is a new generation of open-source text-to-image model launched by the original core team of Stable Diffusion in 2024. Its overall architecture is still based on the LDM concept, but it has made changes and enhancements in several key aspects. Among them, the changes in the VAE module and latent space design are particularly significant.

Flux.1 follows the VAE framework of the Stable Diffusion system (AutoencoderKL class), but increases the latent variable compression ratio to 16, that is, compressing the original image to a latent variable with a size of $1/16$ of the original image. This means that for a $512\times512$ image, the latent variable tensor size of Flux.1 is approximately $32\times32$, which is half the side length (area reduced to 1/4) smaller than Stable Diffusion's $64\times64$. Superficially, increasing the compression ratio tends to weaken the VAE reconstruction quality because the latent space representation is "smaller". However, Flux.1 cleverly adopts a "space-to-channel" approach to alleviate information loss under high compression ratios: after the model obtains a $64\times64\times16$ latent variable feature map at the encoder output, it does not directly use it as input to the diffusion model, but first concatenates adjacent $2\times2$ latent variable blocks in the channel dimension (`_pack_latents` operation) to generate a $32\times32\times64$ latent variable tensor. In other words, Flux.1 reduces the spatial resolution by half while increasing the number of channels by four times to maintain the information capacity of the latent variable representation unchanged (the total number of features $64\times64\times16$ and $32\times32\times64$ are both 65536). This processing makes Flux.1 nominally achieve a VAE compression ratio of 16, but the information content of the latent vector is comparable to Stable Diffusion's scheme of increasing the latent variable dimension (such as SD3's latent variable channel 16). The difference is that Flux.1 puts this "tiling/untiling" (packing/unpacking) operation outside the diffusion model: the encoder output is still a 16-channel feature map, the diffusion process accepts the packed 64-channel tensor, and finally, before the decoder, it is unpacked and restored to a 16-channel feature and then the image is reconstructed. This design has two major benefits: (1) Accelerating diffusion model computation: reducing the spatial size by half reduces the number of pixels that the diffusion U-Net/Transformer needs to process to 1/4 of the original, thereby reducing computational complexity and memory footprint; (2) Balancing representation capability: by increasing the number of channels, the total dimension of the latent variable is maintained, minimizing detail loss caused by over-compression. Flux.1 source code shows that the input channel of Stable Diffusion 3's diffusion UNet is 16 (the same as the number of VAE latent space channels), while the input channel of Flux.1's diffusion network is increased to 64—which is exactly the result of the above 2×2 concatenation. This means that Flux.1's denoising network uses a higher-dimensional latent representation as input.

Flux.1's diffusion model architecture also has significant changes compared to Stable Diffusion 1/2's U-Net: Flux introduced a module called `FluxTransformer2DModel`, which is essentially a hybrid architecture containing parallel diffusion Transformer blocks. According to blog introductions, Flux.1 added parallel single-stream Transformer blocks after the "dual-stream Transformer" blocks (possibly referring to image stream and text stream processed separately and then fused) in the original Stable Diffusion 3, and adopted RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) to replace the original sinusoidal position embedding. This design indicates that Flux.1's denoising model focuses more on the Transformer structure to capture global correlations and multimodal information. Since Transformer is sensitive to sequence length (the computational overhead of self-attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens), Flux.1 compresses the latent variable space to a 32×32 sequence (64-dimensional features per position) and then applies Transformer, which helps alleviate the computational bottleneck of self-attention at high resolutions. In summary, Flux.1 achieves a new architecture that accelerates model inference while ensuring generation quality through a higher latent space compression ratio + channel rearrangement, combined with a Transformer backbone.

### Traditional Autoencoder Models

After introducing the architectures of Stable Diffusion and Flux.1, we also need to understand the characteristics of other related autoencoder architectures for comparison in the following sections.

First, the classic convolutional autoencoder (AE) is a compression network without random sampling. The encoder directly outputs a deterministic low-dimensional feature representation, and the decoder reconstructs based on this. If the capacity of such an AE is sufficient, it can achieve very low reconstruction error on the training data, but due to the lack of constraints, its latent space may not be continuous, and there is a risk of overfitting the training set.

In contrast, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) adds randomness and regularization to the AE: the encoder outputs distribution parameters (mean and variance), obtains latent vectors through reparameterization sampling, and applies KL divergence loss to encourage the latent vectors to approach a smooth prior distribution (such as standard normal). This mechanism makes the latent space of the VAE smoother and more continuous, which is conducive to generative models performing random sampling and interpolation in this space.

However, when standard VAEs decode and reconstruct, reconstruction blur (loss of detail) often occurs due to the distribution constraints on the latent space, which is a trade-off introduced by KL regularization. To improve reconstruction quality, researchers have proposed various extensions: one of them is the VQ-VAE mentioned above, which uses a discrete codebook to replace Gaussian sampling, no longer imposes KL penalties on continuous distributions, but ensures that the latent variable expression is concise and meaningful through codebook training. The advantage of VQ-VAE is that the reconstructed image is sharper and details are better preserved because the decoder directly receives discrete prototype vectors without the blurring effect of Gaussian noise. At the same time, discrete latent variables are convenient for cooperating with autoregressive models to establish priors for generation tasks (such as PixelCNN or Transformer to generate codeword sequences). VQ-VAE is also often used in the field of image compression, and its codebook index can be regarded as a compact image representation that is easy to entropy encode. However, VQ-VAE training needs to address the challenges of codebook updates (such as avoiding code collapse and ensuring codebook utilization), which is more complex than ordinary VAEs. Another related architecture is VAE-GAN or VQ-GAN (proposed by Esser et al. in 2021), which combines the discrete representation of VQ-VAE and the adversarial training of GAN discriminators. Through perceptual loss and adversarial loss, the reconstruction image quality is significantly improved, and it is often used for high-fidelity image generation. In some works before Stable Diffusion (such as DALL·E and VQ-GAN-CLIP), VQ-VAE/GAN played the role of image encoder, providing discrete representations for downstream generative models. Stable Diffusion chose the VAE scheme, which is equivalent to achieving better reconstruction results "without losing continuity".

### Other Advanced Models

Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE) is a recently proposed family of deep compression autoencoders, specifically designed to accelerate high-resolution diffusion models. DC-AE can be seen as an academic extension of Flux.1's idea of increasing the compression ratio: it focuses on maintaining acceptable reconstruction quality even at higher compression ratios (e.g., spatial downsampling by 64x or even 128x). The core innovations of DC-AE include:

1. Residual Autoencoding: This is a new encoding architecture that first performs spatial compression on the input image (e.g., tiling the image into channels, i.e., the so-called "space-to-channel" transformation), and then allows subsequent networks to only learn residual details based on this simplified representation. By introducing non-parametric skip connections, part of the information is passed directly without going through the network, and the network only needs to learn to compensate for the details lost under high compression, which reduces the optimization difficulty. It can be understood as: DC-AE does not let the encoder compress all the information of the image from scratch, but first makes a rough compression approximation, and then uses the learned residuals to recover the error, so that effective reconstruction can still be trained under extremely high compression ratios. Flux.1's "tiling packing" is also a kind of space-to-channel non-parametric operation to some extent, but DC-AE integrates this idea into the autoencoder architecture itself and adds an explicit residual learning path, making optimization easier.
2. Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation: This is a three-stage training strategy proposed for training high-resolution data. Simply put, DC-AE first trains a basic autoencoder on low-resolution data, and then gradually increases the resolution and performs adaptive fine-tuning at each stage to alleviate the convergence problem of training high-resolution and high-compression models at once. Through these two technologies, DC-AE successfully increased the latent space compression ratio to 128 (that is, reducing the image side length by 128 times!) while still maintaining good reconstruction quality. For example, its paper reports that when spatial compression of 128x is achieved on a $512\times512$ image, the reconstruction quality is almost lossless, and the training and inference of the diffusion model are greatly accelerated by smaller latent variables. It can be considered that DC-AE is one of the current academic frontiers in exploring extreme compression efficiency under the LDM framework. It has a similar goal to Flux.1—both are to accelerate diffusion models, but DC-AE uses novel training strategies to enable single-stage autoencoders to handle extremely high compression, which is a step further than Flux.1.

In addition, another architecture "Würstchen" (Sausage) and its derived Stable Cascade model are worth mentioning. Würstchen is a new text-to-image diffusion scheme proposed in 2023, which adopts multi-stage compressed diffusion: the first stage uses a highly compressed latent space for diffusion generation, and the second stage uses super-resolution diffusion to complete the image details. According to reports, Stable Cascade (based on the Würstchen architecture) has increased the compression ratio to 42x, and can compress a $1024\times1024$ image to a latent space of only $24\times24$. Such high compression and the use of a two-stage/three-stage diffusion process make its inference speed 16 times faster than previous models while ensuring generation quality.

It can be seen that, whether in a single-stage (such as Flux.1, DC-AE) or multi-stage (such as Würstchen) framework, increasing the VAE compression ratio has become a common theme in recent diffusion model architecture innovations. In the following, we will combine these architectures to specifically compare their performance differences.

## Performance Comparison: Efficiency and Quality Trade-off

After understanding the architectural principles, we will compare and analyze Flux.1, Stable Diffusion, and traditional methods (VQ-VAE, DC-AE, etc.) from key indicators such as computational efficiency, reconstruction quality, compression ratio, and inference speed.

### Computational Efficiency and Model Scale

The diffusion model (UNet) of Stable Diffusion 1.x has approximately 800-900 million parameters, and the VAE part is about tens of millions of parameters. Overall inference can be run on consumer-grade GPUs. Flux.1, as a new generation model, has significantly increased its parameter scale (reportedly, the `Flux.1 [pro]` version has as many as approximately 12 billion parameters). Such a huge model brings about an increase in computational and storage costs while pursuing higher generation quality.

Flux.1 offsets part of the increase in computation by using a higher compression ratio VAE: reducing the latent space from 64×64 to 32×32 reduces the number of tokens processed by the diffusion Transformer to 25%, and the computational overhead of self-attention is greatly reduced. The acceleration effect brought by this is particularly obvious in the same hardware environment. For example, in experiments by MIT Han Lab et al., comparing different VAEs under the same diffusion model, the VAE compression 8x (SD-VAE-f8) commonly used in Stable Diffusion can train and process approximately 352 512x512 images per second, while increasing the compression ratio to 16x (SD-VAE-f16) can increase to 1550 images/second, and compression 32x can reach 12880 images/second. This verifies the significant improvement in throughput brought by increasing the compression ratio (f16 is approximately 4.4 times faster than f8, and f32 is approximately 8 times faster than f16). The actual inference speed of Flux.1 also has significant advantages due to its latent space compression and efficient architecture. Reports indicate that the generation speed of the streamlined version `Flux.1 [schnell]` is comparable to commonly used models such as Stable Diffusion, achieving smooth operation even on local machines without high-end GPUs. Of course, the full `Flux.1 [pro]` model still requires higher memory (developers recommend GPUs with 24GB or more) for inference due to its extremely large parameters.

In contrast, the contribution of the DC-AE method focusing on acceleration is extremely prominent: the high-compression autoencoder it proposed increases the training and inference speed of diffusion models by one to two orders of magnitude on the same hardware. For example, applying DC-AE to a large diffusion Transformer (UViT-H) on ImageNet 512×512 accelerates training by approximately 17.9 times and inference by 19.1 times, while the FID of the generated images is even better. This means that through stronger VAE compression, the improvement in computational efficiency can offset or even outperform the overhead of model enlargement, making "fast and good" possible.

Overall, in terms of computational efficiency: traditional VAE (8x) < Flux.1 increased compression (16x) < DC-AE/Würstchen and other ultra-high compression schemes. The latter two show the potential to push the latent space compression ratio to the limit in exchange for a multiple increase in speed without significantly sacrificing quality.

### Reconstruction Quality and Compression Loss

Increasing the compression ratio often comes at the cost of reconstruction quality. We need to examine the performance of different methods in maintaining image fidelity.

Stable Diffusion's default VAE (8x compression, 4-channel latent variables) uses techniques such as perceptual loss during training, which can reconstruct natural images well, but still introduces slight blurring and color distortion. Some users have noticed that the eye details of characters generated by SD1.x models are not good enough, and community-tuned VAEs (such as improved versions trained only with MSE) can improve detail sharpness to a certain extent.

Flux.1 doubles the compression ratio to 16x. If no special processing is done, the VAE reconstruction quality may decrease significantly. However, it tries to maintain reconstruction ability by increasing channels and retraining the VAE. However, comparisons from empirical data reveal that the reconstruction quality of the original Flux.1 VAE is not as good as that of Stable Diffusion's VAE. A study compared the image generation of Flux.1's VAE and Stable Diffusion 1.5's VAE applied to the same diffusion model, and found that Flux.1 VAE converged slower and performed worse.

A more direct indicator comparison comes from the DC-AE paper's evaluation of these VAEs: in the ImageNet image reconstruction experiment, the reconstruction FID of Flux-VAE (8x) is as high as 106.07 (no CFG condition) / 84.73 (with CFG)—the higher the value, the worse the generation quality. The reconstruction FID of Stable Diffusion VAE (8x) is only 51.96 (no CFG) / 24.57 (with CFG), which is significantly better than Flux.1 VAE. This shows that under the same 8x compression setting, Flux.1's VAE has greater reconstruction distortion (FID is several times higher), which may be speculated that because Flux.1 VAE pursues channel information and high compression, it is more difficult to optimize than Stable VAE, resulting in insufficient detail modeling. When the compression ratio is increased, this gap is further magnified: when Stable Diffusion VAE is compressed 16x, the generated FID deteriorates to 76.86/44.22 (no/with CFG); when 32x, the FID is 70.23/38.63 (interestingly, f32 is slightly better than f16 under no CFG, which may be related to random factors, but overall it is still much worse than 8x). Flux.1's default 16x, due to the channel packing strategy, the actual FID is not explicitly given by the official, but from the trend, it should be at the Stable 16x level or worse.

However, DC-AE demonstrates excellent high-compression reconstruction quality: under conditions equivalent to 32x compression, the generation FID of DC-AE-f32 is only 46.12/18.08, and the latter (with CFG 18.08) is even better than Stable VAE 8x's 24.57. That is, DC-AE improves the compression ratio by 4 times while the image quality is better. This is inseparable from its residual encoding strategy effectively compensating for information loss. Even under 64x compression, the guided FID of DC-AE is approximately 35.96, which is slightly higher than Stable8x's 24.57, but still far lower than Stable's own 44.22 at 64x (or even Flux.1's 84.73 at 8x). From reconstruction fidelity indicators such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), the difference between high-compression VAEs is also obvious. Taking ImageNet 512×512 data as an example, under 64x compression (latent space 1/64), the reconstruction PSNR of the original Stable Diffusion VAE is only about 19.49dB, SSIM 0.48, while DC-AE improves to 26.15dB, SSIM 0.71, LPIPS decreases from 0.282 to 0.080, and reconstruction FID also decreases significantly from 16.84 to 0.22. This shows that DC-AE, even with aggressive compression, can still reconstruct images that are almost lossless to the naked eye. If Stable VAE is compressed to such a high level (for example, 128x attempted in the paper), the image almost collapses (PSNR drops to 15.9dB, LPIPS is as high as 0.531).

Therefore, in terms of reconstruction quality, Flux.1 VAE ≈ Stable VAE performs acceptably under medium compression, but when entering high compression ratios (16x and above), the quality of traditional VAEs drops sharply; specially designed models like DC-AE greatly reduce the quality loss caused by compression.

For VQ-VAE, generally speaking, its reconstruction quality can reach a very high level (horizontally close to imperceptible distortion) because the decoder has no noise disturbance, but due to the grid effect brought by quantization, some blocky artifacts may appear. However, in text-to-image applications, VQ-VAE is often trained in combination with perceptual/adversarial loss, making the subjective quality of reconstructed images excellent—which is also why the authors of Stable Diffusion once reported that VQ-VAE achieved the best FID. It's just that this advantage may not translate into better text-to-image generation quality in the overall generation pipeline because the continuity and adjustability of the latent space are also important.

### Compression Ratio and Representation Dimension

The latent variable compression ratio of VAE directly determines how much data is used to represent each image. The compression ratio of 8 for Stable Diffusion VAE roughly means that each 512×512 image is described by 64×64×4 ≈ 16k latent variables; after Flux.1 increases to a compression ratio of 16, the number of latent variables per 512 image is reduced to 32×32×16 = 16k (the increase in channels offsets part of it, but Flux's storage channels are 16 before packing or 64 after packing, and each calculation method is different). If purely from the perspective of data compression, Stable Diffusion's 16k floating-point representation is still quite redundant (accounting for about 64KB, and there is still compression space if further quantized). VQ-VAE provides a more traditional codec idea: for example, a typical VQ-VAE may compress a 256×256 image into 32×32 codewords, that is, 1024 discrete indices. If the codebook size is 8192 (requiring 13 bits to encode an index), then each image needs approximately 1024×13 = 13312 bits (1.66KB) for representation, which is a higher compression ratio than JPEG and others. At the same time, VQ is naturally suitable for entropy-coded transmission and has practical potential. In contrast, Stable Diffusion's continuous latent codes are not directly equivalent to efficient encoding if they are not further compressed and stored; but if an independent entropy model (such as Hyperprior by Ballé et al.) is trained for its latent variables, it can be completely used as an image compression codec.

Some community experiments show that saving the latent variables of SD and then decoding them can obtain smaller files than directly saving PNGs and almost lossless VAE reconstruction effects. DC-AE is more attractive in this regard because it can maintain image quality in a smaller latent space. This means that if the high-compression latent variables obtained by DC-AE are further quantized and encoded, it is expected to reach or even exceed the performance of existing image compression standards. In addition, the high compression ratio of the latent representation also directly affects the detail resolution ability of the model generation: when Stable Diffusion uses 8x latent space, problems such as small text being unrecognizable and thin lines being easily distorted have already appeared because a 64×64 latent image represents a 512×512 image, and each latent pixel corresponds to an 8×8 area of the original image. This is also why "Hires. fix" and other techniques are often used when generating high-definition details, first generating at low resolution and then super-resolving to supplement details.

Flux.1 reduces the latent image to 32×32 (each latent pixel corresponds to a 16×16 original image), which is theoretically more challenging for depicting minute details, but Flux may compensate for some loss through the powerful modeling and high channels of the diffusion model. In applications, users report that Flux.1 generates complex scenes and anatomical structure details excellently, even better than previous models—this may be attributed to its larger model and improved training, even if the latent variables are more compact, they can still depict details.

Overall, the trade-off between compression ratio and representation ability of different methods needs to be considered in combination with specific tasks: for tasks that focus on fine structures (such as image generation with text), it may be preferable to reduce the compression ratio in exchange for local realism of the latent space; while for global creation or situations with high acceleration requirements, high-compression latent space is more advantageous.

### Inference Speed and Scalability

In practical applications, inference speed often determines the practical value of a model. The previous section mentioned the improvement in speed due to the compression ratio. Here, we summarize the inference efficiency of each method from the perspective of the overall system.

Stable Diffusion 1.x generally takes several seconds to generate a single 512×512 image (depending on the number of sampling steps and hardware), and SDXL is slightly slower due to the larger model. Although Flux.1 is a larger model, it has launched the `[dev]` version obtained through "guided distillation" and the `[schnell]` version specially optimized for speed, which greatly improves the generation speed while maintaining similar quality. In particular, the `[schnell]` version is said to be more than 2 times faster than the `[pro]` version, making Flux.1 able to generate higher-resolution images in near real-time on consumer-grade GPUs, which is very important for interactive applications.

DC-AE and other methods can further improve inference latency if applied to the Stable Diffusion framework. For example, replacing the VAE of the original Stable Diffusion model with DC-AE-f32 makes the entire process faster and has better FID under the same sampling steps. It is worth noting that when the latent space compression ratio is extremely high like Würstchen, the diffusion process is split into multiple stages. The total steps of multiple diffusions increase, but the computational load of each stage is reduced and can be optimized in parallel, so the comprehensive effect is still significantly faster. This suggests that the bottlenecks in inference may be different for different architectures—the inference overhead of heavier VAEs (such as high channels, large resolution latent space) is more in encoding and decoding; the overhead of larger diffusion models is in each sampling step; Transformer-like models are sensitive to parallelism and sequence length; and cascaded models need to coordinate the efficiency of stages.

Overall, new architectures such as Flux.1, DC-AE, and Stable Cascade are all striving to shorten the generation time of "unit images": Flux.1 uses fewer positions and more channels to make Transformer run efficiently, DC-AE makes UNet smaller and faster with the same number of steps, and Cascade uses resolution staging to generate rough images with fewer steps and then refine them. In tests on the same hardware, Stable Cascade (Würstchen) only needs one-sixteenth of the computational cost of Stable Diffusion 1.5 to complete generation; the `Flux.1 [schnell]` version is also expected to reach a speed close to or even faster than Stable Diffusion 1.5 in 512×512 generation. For VQ-VAE, it has little impact on inference speed itself (the overhead of codebook lookup is very small), but if autoregressive Transformer is used to generate codeword sequences subsequently, the speed will be much slower than diffusion (generating a complete image may require thousands of steps of sequence sampling). Therefore, in terms of end-to-end inference, the LDM combined with VAE method is still more efficient at present.

## Development History: Evolution of VAE and LDM

To fully understand the origins and development of the above models and methods, it is necessary to briefly review the development history of VAE-related technologies and the context of the rise of latent diffusion models.

### Origin of VAE

The concept of VAE was proposed by Kingma and Welling in 2013 and is a milestone in deep generative models. Classic VAEs enable models to explicitly learn the latent probability distribution of data by introducing random latent variables and variational inference in the encoder-decoder. Early VAEs were not as good as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in terms of image generation quality—VAE-generated images were often blurry, while GANs could produce sharp images.

However, VAEs have been deeply studied due to their good theoretical properties (interpretable latent space, smooth interpolation, stable training process). In 2016-2017, VAE technology saw several important improvements: Beta-VAE introduced hyperparameters to adjust KL weights to learn more interpretable latent variables; VQ-VAE (2017) solved the problems of "posterior collapse" and reconstruction blur, and was successfully used to generate high-quality speech and images by discretizing the latent space, showing outstanding performance in unpaired data representation learning. The development of autoregressive models such as PixelCNN and WaveNet in the same period also verified the power of VQ-VAE discrete representation. In 2018-2019, VQ-VAE-2 proposed a hierarchical multi-scale discrete latent space, which can generate diverse samples on high-complexity data (such as full ImageNet images). Another line is to combine VAE and GAN, such as VAE-GAN, which improves the visual realism of reconstruction by introducing a discriminator. In 2020-2021, OpenAI's DALL·E (2021) used a two-stage strategy: first training a VQ-VAE to compress images into discrete codes, and then training a Transformer model to perform text-to-image generation on codebook index sequences. This approach proves that high-quality text-to-image generation does not necessarily require direct operation in pixel space, and it is feasible to first compress images to latent space and then generate. In the same year, Esser et al.'s VQGAN+CLIP method became popular in the open-source community, which also used VQGAN to encode image latent space and CLIP-guided generation to realize the prototype of early "AI drawing". It can be said that by 2021, discrete latent space + generative models had shown great potential, but there were also obvious shortcomings: Transformer's sampling efficiency in long sequences (such as 32×32=1024 codes) was very low, making it often take tens of seconds or even minutes to generate a large image.

### Rise of Latent Diffusion

Diffusion Models rose in the field of image generation in 2020 (such as DDPM), and attracted attention in 2021-2022 for their stable training and image quality superior to GANs. The R&D team of the Technical University of Munich and Stability AI (Rombach et al.) combined diffusion models with latent variable representations in 2022 and proposed Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). The core idea is as mentioned above: using a pre-trained perceptual loss autoencoder (similar to the VQGAN structure but with continuous latent variables) to compress images to reduce the operating dimension of the diffusion model, so that the diffusion model can be successfully applied to high-resolution images and multimodal generation.

LDM achieved great success in the second half of 2022 with the open source of Stable Diffusion, becoming a milestone in the field of AI art creation. The Stable Diffusion v1 series followed the architecture described by the CompVis team in their paper: 4-channel latent, 8x downsampling VAE, and U-Net diffusion model integrated with text Transformer. Since then, the Stable Diffusion community has flourished and many derivative models have emerged (such as various finetunes, LoRA fine-tuning, etc.), but the basic architecture remains unchanged.

From the end of 2022 to 2023, Stability AI launched Stable Diffusion 2.0 (improved text encoder, removed some undesirable content, VAE was also retrained but the compression ratio remained 8) and SDXL (Stable Diffusion XL). SDXL is a significant upgrade to the architecture: UNet is split into two stages (0.9 and 1.0 two model cascades), two text encoders are used (CLIP ViT-L and a UniCLIP text encoder), and the latent space dimension is larger (SDXL's VAE output channel is increased to 8, latent variables changed from 4 to 8, which is speculated by the community to improve latent representation ability). The results of SDXL are significantly improved compared to 1.x and are considered to have reached a level close to closed-source models (such as Midjourney). Nevertheless, SDXL is still limited by single-step inference speed, and it takes dozens of diffusion steps and tens of seconds to generate a high-quality image.

Würstchen (Stable Cascade), which appeared in the second half of 2023, adopted aggressive multi-stage compressed diffusion, further compressing the latent space from 8x to 42x or even higher, and using 3-stage diffusion (ultra-low resolution main generation + medium resolution refinement + high resolution re-refinement). This method greatly reduces inference speed and memory usage, and also proves that latent variable diffusion can still produce reasonable images under extreme compression.

During the same period, the original Stable Diffusion development team left and founded Black Forest Labs, releasing Flux.1 (August 2024). Flux.1 can be regarded as a variant and spiritual continuation of Stable Diffusion 3. Since Stability AI had not yet officially released SD3 at that time, Flux.1 actually filled this gap and caused a sensation in the open-source community. Flux.1 introduced the architectural improvements analyzed in detail above (tiling, stronger Transformer, guidance distillation without CF guidance, etc.), and its generation effect is said to be comparable to closed-source models such as Midjourney, with excellent performance in high resolution, complex scenes, and character details.

On the other hand, many papers related to latent space diffusion also emerged in academia in 2024: for example, DC-AE (ICLR 2025) by MIT-Han Lab et al. officially proposed a high-compression autoencoder scheme, providing strong support for accelerating diffusion models; CV-VAE (2023) proposed by Tsinghua University and other teams focuses on VAE extensions in video generation, solving the problem of lack of temporal consistency when applying 2D image VAEs to video. CV-VAE proposed a 3D spatiotemporal VAE compatible with image models, which makes it possible to use the weights of pre-trained Stable Diffusion image VAEs to initialize video VAEs, and then learn the compression of the time dimension, thereby realizing truly spatiotemporal compressed latent variable video diffusion. This work shows that VAE technology has also begun to play a key role in the field of video generation, improving efficiency and consistency through joint compression in space and time.

In summary, from the initial development of the VAE concept to its combination with quantization, adversarial training, and then as a pillar of diffusion models, its goal has always revolved around more effectively representing data. The emergence of LDM has pushed VAE to a new height, making it a bridge connecting high-dimensional data (images/videos) and complex generative models. Looking to the future, we can foresee more efficient and intelligent VAEs or other latent encoders emerging continuously, further improving the performance and application scope of generative models.

## Experimental Data and Case Analysis

To more intuitively compare these methods, in this section, we combine experimental data and cases from existing literature to analyze the performance of different models in scenarios such as image and video reconstruction and compression.

### Image Reconstruction Experiments

The DC-AE paper provides a set of reconstruction comparison experiments on standard datasets, which well quantifies the differences between traditional VAEs (such as Stable Diffusion's VAE) and new methods (DC-AE). For example, on the FFHQ face dataset (1024×1024), training autoencoders with a 64x compression ratio, DC-AE's reconstruction PSNR reaches 31.04dB, which is much higher than the traditional VAE's 24.55dB, and the perceptual distance LPIPS is reduced by more than 4 times. The reconstructed samples show that ordinary VAEs produce obvious blurring and artifacts due to over-compression, while DC-AE reconstructs faces with clear facial features and rich texture details. On the ultra-high-resolution Mapillary Vistas landscape data (2048×2048), the 128x compression comparison is even more distinct: traditional VAEs can hardly restore the scene outline (reconstruction FID as high as 152), while DC-AE can still reconstruct the structure of roads and buildings well (FID only 0.36).

These quantitative and qualitative results prove that through Residual AE and staged training, high-compression autoencoders can greatly reduce the gap between reconstruction quality and the original image, and even maintain the overall recognizability and detail quality of the image under extreme compression. This is of great significance for image transmission and storage—greatly reducing the amount of data while ensuring visual quality. In contrast, the VAE used by Stable Diffusion is difficult to be competent if it is used directly for such high-compression reconstruction tasks: for example, in the above example, Stable VAE's FID soared to over 100 at 128x, which has lost its practical value. Flux.1's VAE is not directly present in the paper's experiments, but from Flux's architecture, its VAE compression ratio is between 8x and 16x (effective information retention is comparable to Stable16x).

It is speculated that Flux.1 VAE may be slightly inferior to Stable8x in terms of objective indicators of image reconstruction, but better than Stable16x—that is, it can maintain acceptable PSNR/SSIM under a compression ratio of one time. This can be felt through the samples given by Flux official: some reconstruction and generated images shown when Flux.1 was released (such as examples in official tweets) compared with Stable Diffusion generation results, the naked eye can hardly see the resolution loss caused by different VAEs. In other words, Flux.1 successfully hides the compression cost within an "imperceptible" range, which is its engineering ingenuity. However, when professional tasks require lossless or high-fidelity reconstruction, Flux.1 VAE is ultimately not as good as models with more conservative compression or dedicated compression frameworks.

### Image Generation Quality Comparison

In text-to-image generation tasks, there are a large number of comparative tests and user feedback for each model. Horizontal evaluations of models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5, SDXL, Flux.1, and even Midjourney are all over social media.

Here, we cite a set of FID comparisons obtained by MIT Han Lab experiments using the same diffusion model and different VAEs to analyze the impact of VAE on generation quality: using a Transformer-based diffusion model, on ImageNet 512×512 class-conditional generation, when using Stable VAE-8x, FID=24.57 (lower is better), after switching to Flux VAE-8x, FID rises to 84.73 (quality drops significantly), while using DC-AE-32x can still achieve FID=18.08 (even better). This set of results impressively illustrates that VAE quality has a great impact on generation results, even possibly greater than the diffusion model architecture itself. Flux.1 VAE performed poorly in this experiment, suggesting that its latent variables may have lost some key information or introduced bias, causing the diffusion model to fail to accurately restore the training distribution.

From the user level, some artists also reported that some generations of Flux.1 have slight flaws in fine textures, requiring post-processing correction. However, Flux officials quickly noticed this problem and may optimize the VAE in subsequent versions (for example, Flux1.1 version is said to have improved stability).

In contrast, the lower FID of DC-AE proves that high-compression latent space does not hinder generation quality, and even due to more refined reconstruction capabilities, the diffusion model can "trust" the details in the latent variables. This also explains why Stable Diffusion XL has improved the quality of generated realistic styles and complex scenes after increasing the VAE capacity (8 channels)—a stronger VAE reduces distortion and provides a better "canvas" for the diffusion model. A common case is that SDXL has obvious progress compared to SD1.5 when generating images containing text (such as simulated posters or signs), and the text is more recognizable. This is attributed to the improvement of VAE resolution and the increase of model capacity, which enables the latent space to express clear character structures. In this sense, VAE and diffusion model form a synergistic relationship: VAE determines the upper limit of details that the model can depict, while the diffusion process determines how to use these details to match conditional requirements.

For artistic creation applications, users often pursue rich details and textures, so huge parameter models like Flux.1 can be well received in the community because it generates more realistic skin texture, fabric texture, and light and shadow effects. Behind this, in addition to the power of the diffusion model itself, the larger latent space (although Flux is compressed 16x, it has 16 channels packed, which is equivalent to the amount of information similar to SDXL 8 channels) also plays a non-negligible role.

### Video Reconstruction and Generation Applications

Applying VAE and diffusion models to the video field is one of the current research hotspots. Video has an additional time dimension compared to images, which means more data needs to be compressed and represented.

As mentioned earlier, many video diffusion models directly reuse Stable Diffusion's 2D image VAE to encode video frames frame by frame. For example, open-source video generators such as ModelScope and VideoCrafter take the pre-trained SD AutoencoderKL to extract latent variables for each frame, and then train a temporal UNet to generate movies on these latent variable sequences. The advantage of doing this is that it can make full use of the achievements of image models (avoiding the cost of training 3D VAEs), but the cost is poor consistency between video frames. Because 2D VAEs compress frame by frame independently, without explicitly modeling the redundant information across frames, the generated video may have flicker or discontinuity between frames. A typical case is early Video Diffusion generation. Once the scene is complex or the motion is drastic, the shape of objects is prone to jumping in adjacent frames. This is actually because the latent space lacks "time compression"—ideally, the latent variables of adjacent frames should show smooth changes over time, but 2D VAEs cannot guarantee this.

To solve this problem, researchers have proposed dedicated video VAEs. The approach of CV-VAE is to train a 3D convolutional VAE, which can compress video in both space and time. Its encoder outputs a discrete spatiotemporal codebook, so that the latents of adjacent frames share common codewords, thereby ensuring basic motion coherence. At the same time, it is compatible with existing 2D image VAEs, which means that the weights of pre-trained image VAEs can be used for initialization, thereby avoiding the difficulty of training 3D VAEs completely from scratch. CV-VAE experiments show that videos generated by models such as VideoGPT using 3D (spatiotemporal) codebooks have significant improvements in continuity. Another work from Microsoft Asia proposed an improved video VAE combining KTC (Keyframe Temporal Compression) and GCConv (Group Causal Convolution), which achieves more efficient video latent encoding by saving full information only in keyframes and using motion prediction for intermediate frames.

These developments all reflect that in video reconstruction/generation, the introduction of time-dimensional VAEs or efficient representations is necessary. Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion themselves are mainly aimed at images, but there are also attempts to use Flux.1 for video frame-by-frame generation and then use optical flow alignment to improve consistency.

Overall, if applied to video reconstruction and compression, traditional VAEs can first compress video frame by frame and then perform entropy coding on the latent sequence (similar to frame-by-frame JPEG for moving images); while more advanced ones such as CV-VAE can directly generate a much smaller "video latent variable", removing spatial and temporal redundancy together, thereby achieving higher compression ratios and smoother reconstruction. Imagine that in the future, a "Stable Diffusion video encoder" may be realized, storing a high-definition video through the latent space representation of the diffusion model, which is more efficient than traditional encoding (such as H.264), and at the same time, content can be selectively edited during decoding (because the latent itself is manipulable). This will be a very revolutionary application case.

### Image Compression Coding Application

Although Stable Diffusion's VAE was originally designed for generation services, it is essentially also an image compressor. Someone did an interesting experiment: encoding an image into latent variables (4×64×64) through SD's VAE, and then only saving these latents (approximately 16K 32-bit floating-point numbers). When an image is needed, it is restored using SD's decoder. The results showed that compared to the original PNG, the latent file was much smaller, and the reconstructed image was almost identical to the image directly output by the VAE.

This suggests that VAEs can be fully used as efficient image encoders, especially in scenarios where lossy compression is allowed. If the latent is further quantized (for example, using 8 bits instead of 32 bits per channel) and then compressed with entropy coding, the file size can be greatly reduced. Taking Stable VAE 8x as an example, $64\times64\times4=16384$ values, even if each uses 1 byte, the overall size is only about 16KB, which is still very small compared to the original 512×512 image (786KB uncompressed, tens to hundreds of KB for JPEG). Of course, color dynamic range, quantization error, etc. still need to be considered in practice, but these can be optimized by training dedicated compression-aware autoencoders.

DC-AE has proven that even if spatial compression is increased to 1/64 or even 1/128, image visual quality can still be maintained well. If its latent is equipped with an appropriate entropy coding scheme, it is expected to achieve higher compression ratios and better perceptual quality than existing optimal image codecs (such as AVIF, WebP, etc.). This is of great significance for future image communication: through deep learning autoencoders, we may break through the compression efficiency bottleneck of traditional compression based on manual feature transformation (DCT, wavelet). Moreover, VAE, as a learning-based encoder, can also adapt to content. It may be particularly efficient for compressing textured images (such as natural landscapes), and can handle text, illustrations, etc. in different ways—this is difficult for static algorithms to balance.

Today, there are already some studies exploring image compression using diffusion models to assist decoding (for example, first compressing to latent, and then introducing generative models to refine decoding). The results show that generative models can improve the subjective quality of reconstruction at ultra-low bit rates. Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion, as general large models, may be slightly bulky in compression applications, but conceptually, only their VAE modules need to be retained to be put into use. It is foreseeable that lightweight versions of "compression-specific VAEs" (such as LiteVAE) may appear in the future to achieve real-time high-quality image compression on mobile devices. In short, from experiments and cases, it can be seen that VAE is no longer just a supporting role in generative models. In the field of image/video reconstruction and compression, it is itself one of the key protagonists, connecting academic exploration and practical applications.

## Application Scenario Analysis

To sum up, Flux.1, Stable Diffusion, and related VAE technologies have shown their respective advantages and applicability in multiple application scenarios.

### Image Reconstruction and Editing

With the help of VAE to map images to the latent space, users can perform various editing operations on the images, and then decode them back into images, realizing powerful image manipulation capabilities. For example, Stable Diffusion's VAE+ diffusion model can be used for image inpainting and image-to-image translation (Img2Img): first encode the original image to obtain latent, modify it in the latent according to user needs (mask replacement, adding noise and redrawing, etc.), and then decode to obtain the edited image. Compared with traditional pixel-level editing, editing in the latent space can often maintain overall style consistency. Flux.1 provides more delicate generation capabilities and is more comfortable in complex scene editing. For example, when adjusting the posture of a character in a crowded street scene image, Flux.1 can redraw the character more accurately without destroying the surrounding environment. In such applications, the reconstruction quality of the VAE directly affects the authenticity of the editing results: stronger VAEs like Flux.1 and SDXL can ensure that the edited image has no obvious distortion and natural edge transitions. At the same time, efficient VAEs also make real-time interaction possible—when a user modifies a detail, the background quickly reconstructs and feeds back the image through latent variables.

### Image Compression Coding

As mentioned earlier, using Flux.1/Stable Diffusion's VAE for image compression can greatly reduce file size while maintaining good visual quality. This is very attractive for scenarios that require transmitting or storing a large number of images (such as social media, cloud image libraries). One possible application is to use large models like Flux.1 on the server side to compress images, and then send the latent to the client, and the client uses a streamlined decoder to restore high-quality images. Since the latent itself is much smaller than JPEG, this will reduce bandwidth consumption. It is even conceivable to install a universal decoding VAE model locally on the client side, so that the server only needs to send very small latent files—this idea is similar to "neural network image format". Of course, for standardization, the problem of non-universality of latent from different models needs to be solved, and perhaps there will be a unified AI compression model standard in the future. The technology demonstrated by DC-AE can also be applied to image compression services, especially in fields such as medical imaging and remote sensing that require high fidelity. DC-AE and others can provide almost lossless compression, which has greater potential than existing methods. Importantly, VAE compression can be continuously improved with model capability upgrades, constantly approaching the limits of human perception, which is difficult for traditional coding algorithms to achieve quickly through iteration.

### Video Reconstruction and Compression

In the video field, the introduction of VAE compression methods has even broader prospects. Imagine that future video encoders are no longer fixed algorithms, but trained neural networks: the encoder compresses the video into a small number of latent codes, and after sending, the decoder network reproduces high-definition video. This is similar to the image situation, but the difficulty lies in temporal consistency and low latency. Research such as CV-VAE has paved the way for "learning-based video coding" by sharing representations in the time dimension through 3D convolution and attention mechanisms. Currently, Flux.1 or Stable Diffusion are not directly used for video compression, but their high-quality image VAEs can be used as building blocks to integrate into video architectures. For example, SDXL's VAE can be used to encode keyframes, and optical flow or Transformer can be used to interpolate and predict intermediate frames, thereby forming a neural video codec. This scheme is expected to significantly improve compression efficiency, and at the same time, due to the generative ability of the latent space, intelligent modification of video content can also be achieved (for example, automatically removing noise and enhancing clarity during compression). For video generation, existing works (such as Tune-A-Video, Video-P2P, etc.) use Stable Diffusion to edit video frame by frame and then cooperate with optical flow correction to achieve changes in video content while maintaining style consistency. This is of great application value in film and television special effects and animation production. It is foreseeable that with the maturity of video VAE technology, latent variable video editing will become more robust, and even users can directly write "scripts" in the latent space, and the model will produce coherent video images.

### Artistic Content Creation

In the fields of art and design, Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion and other models have already shown their talents and become tools for many creators. The role of VAE in this is not obvious, but it is crucial—it ensures that the model's imagination is played out in a real image space. For example, when an artist uses Stable Diffusion to generate a surrealist painting, the VAE ensures that the final output is still a lifelike combination of pixels, and does not deviate too far from the natural image distribution. This constraint on real-world statistics gives AI paintings a fascinating sense of reality. Flux.1 further improves the richness of details and realism of the picture, making artistic style creation even more powerful. Many users report that Flux.1-generated images are superior in terms of light and shadow texture and complex structures, and can better express fantasy scenes or detailed styles. This means that artists can get works that are more in line with their imagination with fewer prompt word adjustments. At the same time, VAE also provides a "canvas" for artists to perform post-processing: for example, some workflows obtain latent from the diffusion model, and then perform style transfer or fusion (mixing) on the latent, and finally decode the image, thereby integrating multiple styles into one image. Since latent is more semantic than pixels, this operation is often more natural than directly processing images. In short, in artistic creation applications, VAE guarantees the image texture of the output, and the diffusion model contributes to composition and creativity, and the two complement each other.

### Other Applications

The combination of VAE and LDM can also be extended to many fields such as 3D generation (projecting 3D data into latent space and then diffusing), cross-modal retrieval (using VAE to compress images to latent, and then aligning in latent space with text embedding), medical image reconstruction (using VAE priors to improve the imaging quality of MRI, etc.), and many other fields. For example, some studies have used the latent space of Stable Diffusion to guide the reconstruction of microscope images, making the reconstruction results clearer and more realistic. These applications all utilize the ability of VAE to construct low-dimensional representations of data and the generative and completion capabilities of diffusion models. It is foreseeable that with the continuous iteration of the Flux series and Stable Diffusion series models, as well as academic exploration of efficient VAEs and new diffusion mechanisms, we will see these technologies in more diverse scenarios.

## Summary and Outlook

Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion and related latent variable diffusion model architectures, by cleverly combining VAE compression and diffusion generation, have achieved remarkable results in high-quality image/video synthesis and reconstruction. This article has detailed the architectural improvements of Flux.1 compared to Stable Diffusion, especially the adjustment of the VAE module—Flux.1 successfully improved the efficiency of the diffusion model while ensuring generation quality by increasing the latent space compression ratio and reorganizing channels. We compared the performance differences between Flux.1, Stable Diffusion, VQ-VAE, DC-AE and other methods: in terms of computational efficiency, high-compression latent space significantly accelerates inference training, but excessive compression of traditional VAEs will lead to a decline in reconstruction quality; new schemes like DC-AE still maintain excellent fidelity and generation effects under high compression. We reviewed the development history of VAE technology from its proposal, quantization to fusion with diffusion models, showing an evolutionary trajectory from pursuing reconstruction accuracy to pursuing compression efficiency, and then to combining generation. Combining experimental data, we see that Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion's VAEs have their own advantages and disadvantages: Stable VAE is more robust, Flux VAE attempts to break through in high compression but needs to be optimized; and the latest DC-AE represents the current top level of efficient VAEs, significantly surpassing previous methods. At the application level, the VAE+LDM framework shows great potential and flexibility in image and video reconstruction, compression, and editing, ranging from improving image transmission efficiency to empowering artistic creation.

With the development of computing hardware and the innovation of algorithms, we may witness the birth of more deeply integrated generative compression models. For example, organically combining VAE, diffusion model and Transformer to build an end-to-end "intelligent perceptual codec" to transmit video in real time at extremely low bit rates; or developing a hybrid latent space model that has both discrete and continuous advantages, ensuring the controllability and diversity of the latent space while maintaining details. In addition, continuously optimized large models (such as subsequent versions of Flux, Stable Diffusion 3/4) may introduce more advanced VAE technologies, such as hierarchical latent space (multi-scale VAE), learnable compression ratio adjustment, etc., so that the model can automatically adjust the compression level according to the task, achieving a dynamic balance between quality and efficiency. The emergence of Flux.1 shows that the open-source community is still rapidly innovating, and the concept of stable diffusion is constantly evolving. It is foreseeable that future text-to-image generation models will have stronger VAEs as backing, making the model both "broad-minded" and "sharp-eyed"—able to quickly understand the compressed world and depict wonderful pictures with fine details. We have reason to believe that the combination of VAE and diffusion model will continue to shine in the field of generated content, and promote visual AI into a new era where efficiency and quality are equally emphasized.

The above analysis hopes to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding and in-depth thinking about Flux.1, Stable Diffusion, and related VAE technologies. Each model and architecture has its own strengths. With the evolution of technology, their advantages may be integrated to promote generative models to new heights. The future is here, let's wait and see.
