When dealing with audio transcription tasks, we often face limitations with traditional Whisper models and local software - especially when working with non-professional recordings or complex audio scenarios. This post introduces how to leverage Google’s **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental 01-21** model (hereafter referred to as the Gemini 2.0 Flash model; unless otherwise specified, references to Gemini 2.0 Flash indicate the Thinking Experimental 01-21 version) on the Google AI Studio platform to achieve high-quality audio transcription and preliminary analysis. This offers developers a more efficient and accurate solution.

## Background

Previously, I primarily relied on OpenAI’s Whisper model for audio-to-text conversion. While `whisper-large-v3` and `whisper-large-v3-turbo` perform well in many scenarios, they still leave room for improvement when handling live recordings, video audio tracks, or audio containing background noise or multi-person dialogue. Some online platforms such as [Podwise](https://podwise.ai/) and local software like [Memo](https://memo.ac/), [superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/), and [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) are essentially bound by Whisper’s inherent capabilities and struggle to perfectly handle transcription and error correction in complex audio.

The main pain points in traditional audio transcription workflows are typically:

1. **Audio Quality Enhancement**:
   Pre-processing is essential, particularly for audio recorded on non-professional equipment.

2. **Multi-Stage Processing**:
   An ideal workflow should include a dedicated Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model and a separate post-processing language model for more accurate transcription and content understanding.

For podcasts and YouTube videos, I’ve found [Podwise](https://podwise.ai/) quite satisfactory for transcription and analysis. However, it does not currently support automatically subscribing to or transcribing Bilibili content, nor does it allow accessing certain paid programs. Manually setting up a private RSS feed is possible, but a more universally applicable solution is still needed.

The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) brings new approaches to addressing these issues. Although multimodal models are not new, LLMs that can handle long contexts while integrating visual/audio/text understanding remain a hot topic in current research. Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash model—particularly its Thinking Experimental 01-21 version—demonstrates significant advantages in these areas. Compared to the 12-19 release, it supports up to 1 million tokens in its context window, which is crucial for long audio transcription and subsequent analysis tasks. Its built-in “reflective” reasoning capability—unavailable in non-Reasoning versions—is critical for producing more accurate initial transcriptions.

Below is a comparative look at how Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental 01-21 excels over traditional solutions:

| Capability         | Whisper Model                       | Gemini 2.0 Flash Model                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Context Window     | —                                   | Supports 1M tokens (approx. 8 hours)   |
| Multimodal Support | Audio only                          | Unified audio/video/text understanding |
| Reflective Ability | None                                | Built-in reasoning and verification    |
| Structured Output  | Post-processing required            | Native JSON/Markdown support           |
| Deployment Cost    | Requires local compute or cloud API | Cloud API as a service                 |

## Practical Steps

In this section, we’ll use a [Bilibili video from 硅谷 101 (Silicon Valley 101)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1KjfjYVEHN/) — titled “傲慢、短视、扼杀创新，垄断巨头英特尔是如何走向倒塌的？” (roughly translated as “Arrogance, Shortsightedness, and Stifled Innovation: How Did Intel’s Monopoly Lead to Its Downfall?”)—to demonstrate how to perform audio transcription using Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.

### Step 1: Download the Audio

First, we need the video’s audio file. You can extract it using the [Bilibili-Evolved](https://github.com/the1812/Bilibili-Evolved) browser script or the command-line tool [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). It is recommended to include cookies with `yt-dlp` so that you can download higher-quality audio/video resources.

### Step 2: Audio Transcription

Next, visit the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) platform. When selecting a model, make sure to choose **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental 01-21** (or a newer release) to ensure the best performance and features.

Within the Google AI Studio interface, upload the audio file you just downloaded and enter a prompt.

For models with reflective reasoning, providing too many prompts can actually limit their effectiveness. To obtain structured transcripts, you can guide the model with minimal, well-crafted prompts. Below are two sample prompts:

#### Example Prompt 1: JSON Output

This prompt instructs the model to output timestamps, speaker labels, and transcripts in JSON format:

```plaintext
Please follow best practices and provide timestamps and verbatim transcripts for this audio.

Output in JSON format, using the following sample as a guide:

[
  {
    "timestamp": "00:00",
    "speaker": "Speaker 1",
    "text": "Transcription 1"
  }
]
```

The model’s response might look something like this (excerpt):

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "00:00",
    "speaker": "Narrator",
    "text": "Chip giant Intel is facing challenges on all sides."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:03",
    "speaker": "Speaker 1",
    "text": "The stock was down more than 60% and the CEO is out."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:07",
    "speaker": "Narrator",
    "text": "By the end of 2024, Intel's year-to-date stock price had plunged nearly 60%, replaced by Nvidia in the Dow Jones index, and its market cap dropped below $100 billion..."
  }
]
```

#### Example Prompt 2: Markdown Output

If you prefer a more readable Markdown format, you can use a prompt like this:

```plaintext
Please follow best practices and provide timestamps and verbatim transcripts for this audio.

Use plain text in the following style:

[Speaker 1]
[Timestamp 1]
[Transcription 1]

[Speaker 2]
[Timestamp 2]
[Transcription 2]
```

The model might return something like this (excerpt):

```markdown
**Narrator**
00:00
Chip giant Intel is facing challenges on all sides.

**Speaker 1**
00:03
The stock was down more than 60% and the CEO is out.

**Narrator**
00:07
By the end of 2024, Intel's year-to-date stock price had plunged nearly 60%, replaced by Nvidia in the Dow Jones index, and its market cap dropped below $100 billion...
```

#### Handling Interruptions and API Calls

Since single model outputs can have length limits, the transcription process may get truncated. If that happens, use a prompt like `continue from incomplete part` to instruct the model to pick up where it left off.

For production environments, it’s advisable to use the model via API calls for more stable and automated transcription workflows.

#### Additional Prompt Tips

- You can add a touch of role-play (e.g., “act as a professional audio-video analyst”) to help the model better understand its task.
- Providing metadata like video title, author, publication date, and description can further assist the model’s comprehension of the audio content.
- After the model’s output, you can request additional checks:
  - Accuracy of technical terminology
  - Consistency in speaker labeling and identification of roles (host/guest/voice-over)
  - Continuity of timestamps (and ensuring timestamps are accurate to the second)
