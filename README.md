# Today I Learned

Welcome to my "Today I Learned" (TIL) repository! This is a personal space to document and share concise notes on various topics I encounter and learn daily. The goal is to create easily digestible snippets of information that can be quickly reviewed and understood. Think of it as a public learning journal to track my learning journey in my free time.

## Table of Contents

> This will be dynamically updated as I add more TILs.

This repository is structured by topic categories. Each "TIL" entry should be a short, focused explanation of a single concept, fact, or skill I've learned. I aim for clarity and conciseness, making each entry a quick and valuable read.
