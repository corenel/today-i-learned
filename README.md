# Today I Learned

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Welcome to my "Today I Learned" (TIL) repository! This is a personal space to document and share concise notes on various topics I encounter and learn daily. The goal is to create easily digestible snippets of information that can be quickly reviewed and understood. Think of it as a public learning journal to track my learning journey in my free time.

## Table of Contents

> This will be dynamically updated as I add more TILs.

This repository is structured by topic categories. Each "TIL" entry should be a short, focused explanation of a single concept, fact, or skill I've learned. I aim for clarity and conciseness, making each entry a quick and valuable read.

### Computer System

- [Insights from John Hennessy: From the RISC Efficiency Revolution to the AI Paradigm Shift, the Next Decade of Computing](./computer-system/20250403-notes-on-john-hennessy-insights/README.md): Turing Award winner John Hennessy has observed that the field of computing is undergoing a profound transformation driven by efficiency. This transformation began with the disruption of processor design concepts by RISC architecture and is now shifting more of the burden of performance enhancement and efficiency optimization to the software layer through heterogeneous computing, domain-specific architectures (DSAs), and artificial intelligence (especially large language models, LLM), against the backdrop of the slowing of Moore's Law.
